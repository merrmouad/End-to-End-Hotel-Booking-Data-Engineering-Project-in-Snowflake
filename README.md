# End-to-End Hotel Booking Data Engineering Project (Snowflake)

This hands-on project demonstrates the design and implementation of a production-style, end-to-end data pipeline fully built within Snowflake, following Medallion Architecture best practices.

## What I Learned & Built

- Loaded raw hotel booking CSV files into Snowflake Stages

- Designed and implemented Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers using Snowflake SQL

- Cleaned and standardized messy data:

- Invalid emails

- Incorrect date formats

- Negative or inconsistent monetary values

- Typos and data quality issues

- Handled missing, corrupted, and inconsistent fields

- Built complete end-to-end transformation logic natively in Snowflake

- Created interactive dashboards using Snowsight (no external BI tool required)

- Applied Medallion Architecture principles for scalable data modeling

- Delivered a fully Snowflake-native, production-ready data pipeline

## Tech Stack

- Snowflake

- Snowflake SQL

- Snowsight Dashboards

- File Formats, Stages & COPY INTO

- Medallion Architecture: Bronze → Silver → Gold
